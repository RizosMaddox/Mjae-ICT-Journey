        <p>
            HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure pages on the web. 
            It provides the basic building blocks of any website, allowing developers to organize content such as 
            text, images, links, and sections.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the most important things I’ve learned is that HTML is all about structure, not design. 
            It tells the browser what each part of a webpage is supposed to be — for example, a paragraph, a heading, 
            a button, or an image. This structure makes websites readable for both humans and computers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Even though HTML looks simple, it plays a huge role in how the internet works. 
            Every website, no matter how advanced, starts with basic HTML. Because of this, understanding the 
            fundamentals of HTML is essential for anyone beginning their coding journey.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also learned that HTML works together with other languages: CSS handles the styling and design, 
            while JavaScript makes websites interactive. But HTML is always the foundation — the skeleton of the site.
        </p>

        <p>
            Learning HTML has made me appreciate how websites are built. 
            It’s the first step toward creating pages that are organized, meaningful, and functional. 
            As I continue coding, I’ll keep building on this foundation.
